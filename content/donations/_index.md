Developing Syncthing costs money, in domain and hosting fees for the various
servers we need to run the operation such as discovery servers, build
servers and this website. Your donations help fund these costs. We also
periodically award grants for the development of specific features, which is
paid for by these donations.

Donate securely using any major credit or debit card, processed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
