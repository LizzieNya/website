Developing Syncthing costs money, in domain and hosting fees for the various
servers we need to run the operation such as discovery servers, build
servers and this website. Your donations help fund these costs. We also
periodically award grants for the development of specific features, which is
paid for by these donations.

[Click to donate securely using any major credit or debit
card.](https://donate.stripe.com/eVadSl1excyx7xScMM) We also accept
donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/syncthing) and
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Syncthing/).

You can manage or cancel your existing recurring donation by visiting the
[subscription portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/9AQ6rx2cLbRhbhS5kk)
and logging in with your email address.

If you experience any issues with the donation handling, regret your
donation and want a refund, or want to cancel a recurring donation please
feel free to contact [donations@syncthing.org](mailto:donations@syncthing.org) at any time.

If you'd like to become a corporate sponsor of the project and be featured here
we're happy to discuss that too!
